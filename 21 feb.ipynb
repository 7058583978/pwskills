    "1]HTML Parsing\n",
    "HTML parsing involves the use of JavaScript to target a linear or nested HTML page. \n",
    "It is a powerful and fast method for extracting text and links (e.g. a nested link or email address), scraping screens and pulling resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2]DOM Parsing\n",
    "The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the structure, style and content of an XML file.\n",
    "Scrapers typically use a DOM parser to view the structure of web pages in depth. DOM parsers can be used to access the nodes that contain \n",
    "information and scrape the web page with tools like XPath. For dynamically generated content, scrapers can embed web browsers like Firefox\n",
    "and Internet Explorer to extract whole web pages (or parts of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "3]Vertical Aggregation\n",
    "Companies that use extensive computing power can create vertical aggregation platforms to target particular verticals.\n",
    "These are data harvesting platforms that can be run on the cloud and are used to automatically generate and monitor bots \n",
    "for certain verticals with minimal human intervention. Bots are generated according to the information required to each vertical,\n",
    "and their efficiency is determined by the quality of data they extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "4]XPath\n",
    "XPath is short for XML Path Language, which is a query language for XML documents. \n",
    "XML documents have tree-like structures, so scrapers can use XPath to navigate through them by selecting nodes according \n",
    "to various parameters. A scraper may combine DOM parsing with XPath to extract whole web pages and publish them on a destination site.\n",
    "\n",
    "5]Google Sheets\n",
    "Google Sheets is a popular tool for data scraping. Scarpers can use the IMPORTXML function \n",
    "in Sheets to scrape from a website, which is useful if they want to extract a specific pattern or data from the website.\n",
    "This command also makes it possible to check if a website can be scraped or is protected."
